# 🚫 Don't Fork! Fix Authentication Instead

## The Problem:
GitHub Desktop thinks you're signed in as: **basamismaeel070-afk**
But the repository belongs to: **Basamismaeel**

That's why it's asking to fork!

---

## ✅ Solution: Sign In as Correct Account

### Step 1: Cancel the Fork Dialog
- Click **"Cancel"** on the fork dialog
- **DO NOT** click "Fork This Repository"

### Step 2: Sign In as Basamismaeel
1. In GitHub Desktop: **GitHub Desktop** → **Preferences** (or **File** → **Options**)
2. Go to **"Accounts"** tab
3. Click **"Sign Out"** (if signed in as wrong account)
4. Click **"Sign In"**
5. Sign in as: **Basamismaeel** (the account that owns the repo)
6. Make sure you see: **Basamismaeel** in the accounts list

### Step 3: Check Repository Settings
1. **Repository** → **Repository Settings**
2. Check **"Remote"** section
3. Should show: `https://github.com/Basamismaeel/Dermalyze.git`
4. If it shows a different account, update it

### Step 4: Try Committing Again
- Now try to commit
- It should work!

## Alternative: Check if You Own the Repo

1. Go to: https://github.com/Basamismaeel/Dermalyze
2. Make sure you're logged in as **Basamismaeel** (not basamismaeel070-afk)
3. Check if you see "You own this repository"
4. If not, you might need to:
   - Transfer the repo to your account
   - Or create a new repo under Basamismaeel

## If You Have Two GitHub Accounts:

You might need to:
1. Sign out of basamismaeel070-afk
2. Sign in as Basamismaeel
3. Or use different credentials for each account

---

## Quick Fix Summary:

1. **Cancel** the fork dialog
2. **Sign out** of GitHub Desktop
3. **Sign in** as **Basamismaeel**
4. Try committing again

**Don't fork** - that creates a copy, not what you want!
